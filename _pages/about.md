I graduated from Wuhan University with a master's degree in the class of 2025. During my studies, I had the opportunity to participate in several science and innovation competitions alongside my classmates, where we were fortunate to receive national awards. I have been honored with national scholarships, excellent academic scholarships, and other recognitions. I have contributed to two papers published in CSSCI journals and some soft-writing works. Additionally, I had the privilege of participating in my mentor's major social science projects and the Hubei National Energy Group cross-project. I also had the opportunity to apply for and manage the Wuhan University State Secrecy Institute's 2023 independent research projects.

In terms of technical skills, I am familiar with Python, basic Linux commands, and MongoDB. I have some experience with third-party libraries such as PyTorch and HuggingFace, and I have developed an understanding of natural language processing and generative artificial intelligence.
